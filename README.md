# Algorithms in Go

This repository implements several basic or well-known algorithms in Go. 

Nothing here is really mine. In most cases, I’ve simply followed pseudocode from [Introduction to Algorithms][ita]. [In one case][ybg], I’ve copied code from [Stefan Nilsson][sn].

In any case, I wrote this to learn a little more about algorithms and to get more comfortable with Go. You shouldn’t use it for anything that matters.
