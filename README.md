# Algorithms in Go

This repository implements several basic or well-known algorithms in Go. 

Nothing here is really mine. In most cases, I’ve simply followed pseudocode from [Introduction to Algorithms][ita]. Sometimes I adapted a program that I found in [A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms][csgdsa]. (Those programs were originally written in Ruby, Python, or Javascript.) [In one case][ybg], I’ve copied code from [Stefan Nilsson][sn].

I wrote this to learn about basic data structures and algorithms and to get more comfortable with Go. You shouldn’t use it for anything that matters, and nobody but me is to blame for the mistakes and bad ideas.
